Specialized data science applications to support higher education.

Public data sources as with the social media, data.gov, AWS and more should be sufficient to accomplish many goals.  As a new aspiring data scientist, it is important to begin to develop strategies and models for the application of techniques that are critical to provide valuable solutions.
